# Mission Statement
To democratize high-end photographic retouching by delivering studio-quality, AI-powered editing from RAW files in minutes through a calm, professional web application.

# Core Values

## 1. Professional-Grade Integrity
We commit to subtle, texture-preserving edits that respect the photographer's original vision and meet industry standards for print and campaigns. This matters because our target users rely on authentic, high-fidelity results for their livelihoods and artistic expression.

## 2. Calm & Focused Experience
We prioritize a minimal, intuitive interface that reduces cognitive load and mirrors the focused environment of a physical retouching studio. This is essential because our users are creative professionals who need tools that enhance, not hinder, their workflow.

## 3. Ethical Transparency & Artist Respect
We openly communicate style inspirations, use only properly licensed or opt-in data for training, and avoid implying artist endorsements without explicit consent. This builds trust in a community sensitive to intellectual property and creative attribution.

## 4. Technological Pragmatism
We leverage cutting-edge AI where it delivers genuine value but ground it in a robust, reliable RAW processing pipeline. This ensures we deliver consistent, high-quality outputs without over-relying on unproven or volatile AI trends.

## 5. User Sovereignty
Users retain full ownership and control of their original files and edited outputs. We design data handling and export options to support seamless integration into existing professional workflows, not lock-in.

# Strategic Objectives

1.  **Quality Leadership:** Achieve a user satisfaction score (CSAT) of ≥4.5/5.0 for "edit quality and subtlety" from professional photographers within 6 months of public beta.
    *   *Success Indicator:* Post-edit survey data from verified pro accounts.
2.  **Market Penetration:** Acquire 2,500 paying subscribers within the first 12 months of full launch.
    *   *Success Indicator:* Active subscription count in billing system.
3.  **Operational Excellence:** Maintain 99.5% system uptime and ensure 95% of jobs complete within 90 seconds for a standard 45MP RAW file.
    *   *Success Indicator:* Infrastructure monitoring dashboards and job processing logs.

# Non-Negotiable Constraints

1.  **Non-Destructive Workflow:** Original RAW files must never be altered. All edits are applied via layers or blending, preserving the source.
2.  **Legal Compliance:** All style presets and any future model training must use licensed, in-house, or explicit user-opt-in imagery. No unauthorized portfolio scraping.
3.  **Browser-First V1:** The MVP must be a fully functional web application accessible via modern desktop browsers. [AI ASSUMED: Native mobile apps are a Phase 2 consideration to focus MVP scope.]
4.  **Subscription Business Model:** The service will be offered via subscription to ensure sustainable funding for ongoing AI inference and storage costs. [AI ASSUMED: A freemium tier with limits is acceptable, but core value requires a paid plan.]

# Decision Framework
When facing competing priorities, decisions will be evaluated in this order:
1.  **Does it uphold Professional-Grade Integrity?** (Quality and authenticity are paramount.)
2.  **Does it enhance the Calm & Focused Experience?** (User workflow efficiency is next.)
3.  **Is it Technologically Pragmatic?** (Can we build and maintain it reliably?)
4.  **Does it support our Strategic Objectives?** (Business and growth impact.)
If options are tied, the one with the clearer path to validating user value through metrics or testing is chosen.
