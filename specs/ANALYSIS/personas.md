# Persona 1: The Scaling Professional
*   **Name and Role:** Anya Petrova, Full-Time Portrait & Beauty Photographer
*   **Demographics:** 32, urban based, independent freelancer, annual revenue $85k-120k.
*   **Technical Proficiency:** Advanced in photography; proficient in Lightroom; competent in Photoshop but finds advanced retouching slow.
*   **Primary Goals:**
    1.  Dramatically reduce time spent on post-production per shoot to increase capacity.
    2.  Deliver a consistent, high-end look to clients that stands out in a competitive market.
*   **Secondary Goals:** Streamline client previews; reduce reliance on (and cost of) outsourcing to freelance retouchers.
*   **Pain Points:** Spends 8-15 hours retouching per shoot, often late nights. Finds achieving consistent skin retouching and color grading across a gallery tedious. Outsourcing is expensive and requires careful briefing.
*   **User Journey Stage:** Decision / Retention (Actively seeking efficiency tools).
*   **Key Quote:** "I love the shooting, but the editing backlog is drowning me. If I could get 80% there in minutes, I could take on two more shoots a month."
*   **Success Scenario:** Anya uploads a full wedding portrait session, applies a "Clean Beauty" preset at 70% intensity to all selects, and has a uniformly polished gallery ready for client review in under an hour, saving her a full day of work.

# Persona 2: The Quality-Conscious Hobbyist
*   **Name and Role:** Ben Carter, Advanced Amateur & Content Creator
*   **Demographics:** 41, suburban, works in a non-creative tech job, significant disposable income invested in gear.
*   **Technical Proficiency:** Intermediate in photography and Lightroom; intimidated by Photoshop's complexity.
*   **Primary Goals:**
    1.  Elevate personal and paid content work to a professional aesthetic without mastering advanced software.
    2.  Achieve a specific, polished "look" for his online photography portfolio and influencer brand.
*   **Secondary Goals:** Learn professional editing styles by analyzing the AI's adjustments; impress peers with his finished work.
*   **Pain Points:** His photos look "good" but not "pro." YouTube tutorials on advanced retouching are time-consuming and hard to replicate. Pre-made Lightroom presets don't handle local adjustments like skin.
*   **User Journey Stage:** Consideration (Looking to bridge the quality gap).
*   **Key Quote:** "I've invested in great cameras and lenses, but my edits are the weakest link. I want my photos to have that magazine-quality polish without a $2,000 software suite and a year of practice."
*   **Success Scenario:** Ben processes his best portrait shots from a weekend shoot. The app gives them a cohesive, cinematic grade and subtle skin refinement. He immediately updates his portfolio website, receiving compliments on the "pro-level" edit quality.

# Persona 3: The Small Studio Owner
*   **Name and Role:** David Chen, Owner/Lead Photographer at a 3-person Fashion Studio
*   **Demographics:** 38, studio owner, manages team and client relationships, annual studio revenue ~$300k.
*   **Technical Proficiency:** Advanced photographer, but delegating; manages a junior retoucher.
*   **Primary Goals:**
    1.  Ensure consistent, on-brand final output across all photographers and projects.
    2.  Increase studio throughput and profit margins by optimizing the post-production pipeline.
*   **Secondary Goals:** Reduce onboarding time for new retouchers; provide faster turnaround to clients as a competitive advantage.
*   **Pain Points:** Inconsistent results when different retouchers work on the same campaign. Junior retoucher's speed is a bottleneck. High-end outsourced retouching eats deeply into project profits.
*   **User Journey Stage:** Decision (Evaluating workflow tools for business impact).
*   **Key Quote:** "Our style is our brand. I need a way to bake that look into our process so every image that leaves here is unmistakably ours, without it depending on one person's unpredictable schedule."
*   **Success Scenario:** David creates a custom studio preset based on their signature look. All photographers upload selects, and the junior retoucher uses the app to apply the base edit to hundreds of images uniformly, then only spends time on final tweaks, doubling the studio's editing capacity.

# Persona 4: The Editorial & Fashion Photographer
*   **Name and Role:** Jasmine Wright, Freelance Editorial Fashion Photographer
*   **Demographics:** 29, travels frequently, works with magazines and direct brand clients, income variable but project-based ($5k-$20k per project).
*   **Technical Proficiency:** Expert in photography and color theory; proficient in Photoshop but selective about its use.
*   **Primary Goals:**
    1.  Experiment with bold color grading and stylistic looks quickly during the creative process.
    2.  Deliver stunning, mood-driven previews to creative directors and clients on tight deadlines.
*   **Secondary Goals:** Maintain the integrity of skin texture and garment detail in high-fashion contexts; have a reliable tool while traveling without a powerful laptop.
*   **Pain Points:** Creating complex color grades and nuanced dodging/burning in Photoshop is slow. Wants to try multiple "looks" on a set quickly. Cloud-based tools she's tried feel gimmicky and degrade image quality.
*   **User Journey Stage:** Consideration / Early Adoption (Seeks cutting-edge tools for creative edge).
*   **Key Quote:** "The mood is everything in editorial. I need to be able to pitch a vision instantly. If I could show a client three radically different, fully realized grades from the shoot within an hour, that's a game-changer."
*   **Success Scenario:** On set, Jasmine uploads a RAW from a tethered shoot, applies a "Dramatic B&W Editorial" preset, and shows the stylist and creative director a near-final image on her iPad before the model leaves hair and makeup, securing approval for the direction instantly.
