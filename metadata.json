  "description": "One-Liner\n\nA web app where photographers upload RAW files and get subtle, high-end AI retouching and color grading—using Nano Banana plus a custom RAW + style pipeline—without opening Photoshop.\n\nProblem & Audience\n\nTarget Users\n\nPortrait, beauty, fashion photographers\n\nSmall studios & freelancers\n\nHigh-end content creators / influencers\n\nAdvanced hobbyists\n\nCore Problem\n\nHigh-end retouching is slow, skill-heavy, and hard to scale. Most AI/photo apps give cheap “filters,” not serious, texture-preserving beauty/fashion retouch suited for print and campaigns.\n\nWhy Now\n\nAI can now do local, face-aware edits and strong color work. Demand for premium imagery is exploding, but the market lacks a calm, pro-grade, browser-based retouch studio.\n\nVision & Value\n\nOutcome:\nDeliver consistent, studio-level retouching and grading from RAW, in minutes, not hours.\n\nValue Promise:\n\nPros: 80–90% of a high-end retouch in seconds, tweakable.\n\nSemi-pros: Skip deep Photoshop; start from world-class baselines.\n\nVibe:\nCalm, minimal, “retouching studio” rather than flashy filter app.\n\nCore Features (V1)\n\nRAW Upload & Base Processing\n\nSupport major RAW formats.\n\nDemosaic, camera profile, WB, exposure normalize.\n\nConvert to 16-bit wide-gamut RGB for AI.\n\nNano Banana–Powered Retouch Engine\n\nSend processed image + style prompt to Nano Banana (or Gemini image API).\n\nReceive edited image, store, and blend with original.\n\nStyle Presets (Inspired, Not Named)\n\nHigh-end retouch presets like:\n\nClean Commercial Beauty\n\nCosmetics/Glossy Beauty\n\nEditorial Fashion\n\nPhotographic looks like:\n\nDramatic Portrait\n\nMinimal B&W Editorial\n\nCinematic Color Story\n\nStyle System & Prompt Engineering\n\nEach preset = structured prompt:\n\nBase task: high-end, subtle retouch, preserve texture.\n\nLook instructions: contrast, color, vibe.\n\nNegative instructions: no reshaping, no plastic skin, no makeup changes.\n\nIntensity slider adjusts AI strength + blending.\n\nGuardrails for Subtlety & Consistency\n\nAlways show before/after.\n\nDefault to moderate intensity, texture-preserving prompts.\n\nBlend AI result with original to avoid overcooking.\n\nConservative defaults for documentary-style looks.\n\nExport\n\nHigh-res JPG (sRGB).\n\nOptional 16-bit TIFF for print/Photoshop.\n\nLegal & Branding Choices\n\nUse big names (Pratik Naik, Julia Kuzmenko, etc.) only as internal references for style design, not in UI.\n\nPublic preset names are generic: “Clean Beauty,” “Cinematic Portrait,” etc.\n\nMarketing language: “inspired by high-end beauty and editorial photography,” not “by [Person].”\n\nTraining data for any future custom models must be licensed, in-house, or user opt-in; no scraping portfolios.\n\nAdd clear terms: styles are not endorsed by any specific artist unless explicitly stated.\n\nRAW + Nano Banana Pipeline (Simple Summary)\n\nUser uploads RAW.\n\nRAW Service → demosaic, normalize, convert to 16-bit RGB.\n\nImage + style preset + slider → Nano Banana via AI Service.\n\nReceive AI-retouched image.\n\nBackend blends with original based on intensity.\n\nUser previews, tweaks, exports.",
