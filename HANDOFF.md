# Luminary Lab - Project Handoff

## Overview
This is an auto-generated handoff document containing all project specifications, architecture decisions, and implementation guidance generated by the Spec-Driven Platform (v3.0).

**Generated:** 2025-12-14T00:50:07.818Z
**Stack Choice:** nextjs_web_only
**Project Slug:** luminary-lab-8cb2c7e7
**Platform Version:** 3.0

---

## Constitutional Articles (Governing Principles)

All specifications in this handoff adhere to five constitutional articles:

1. **Library-First Principle** - Every feature begins as a reusable module with clear boundaries
2. **Test-First Imperative (NON-NEGOTIABLE)** - No implementation code before tests are specified
3. **Simplicity Gate** - Maximum 3 services for MVP; additional complexity requires justification
4. **Anti-Abstraction** - Use frameworks directly; no unnecessary wrappers
5. **Integration-First Testing** - Prefer real databases over mocks in tests

---

## Reading Order

This document should be read in the following order for best understanding:

### Phase 1: Project Foundation (ANALYSIS)
1. **constitution.md** - Project philosophy and guiding principles
2. **project-brief.md** - High-level overview and context
3. **personas.md** - User personas and target audience

> **Note:** Any `[AI ASSUMED: assumption - rationale]` markers indicate AI-generated assumptions. Review these carefully.

### Phase 2: Stack Decision (STACK_SELECTION)
4. **stack-proposal.md** - Recommendation summary
5. **stack-decision.md** - Approved technology stack and composition
6. **stack-rationale.md** - Why this stack was selected, alternatives considered
7. **stack.json** - Canonical machine-readable stack contract

### Phase 3: Specifications (SPEC)
6. **PRD.md** - Product requirements and features
7. **data-model.md** - Database schema and data structures
8. **api-spec.json** - API endpoints and contracts
9. **design-system.md** - Colors, typography, spacing, motion tokens (follow fire-your-design-team.md principles)
10. **component-inventory.md** - UI components mapped to shadcn/ui
11. **user-flows.md** - Key user journeys and interactions

### Phase 4: Dependencies (DEPENDENCIES)
12. **DEPENDENCIES.md** - Dependency rationale (human-readable)
13. **dependencies.json** - Canonical machine-readable dependencies contract

### Phase 5: Implementation Plan (SOLUTIONING)
13. **architecture.md** - System architecture and design patterns
14. **epics.md** - Feature epics and logical groupings
15. **tasks.md** - Detailed implementation tasks with dependencies and parallelism markers

> **Note:** Tasks marked with `[P]` can be executed in parallel.

### Phase 6: Validation (VALIDATE)
16. **validation-report.md** - Cross-artifact consistency check results
17. **coverage-matrix.md** - Artifact coverage by phase

## LLM Code Generation Prompt

Use the following prompt with your preferred LLM (Claude, GPT-4, Gemini, etc.) to generate production-ready code:

```
You are an expert full-stack software engineer tasked with implementing a complete project based on comprehensive specifications.

**Project Name:** Luminary Lab
**Technology Stack:** nextjs_web_only
**Spec-Driven Platform Version:** 3.0

Please review the attached specifications in the order listed above, then:

1. **Understand the requirements** - Read through all specification documents
2. **Validate consistency** - Ensure all documents are consistent and complete
3. **Generate code** - Create production-ready code following all specifications
4. **Structure properly** - Organize code with proper folder structure and conventions
5. **Add documentation** - Include inline comments and README files
6. **Consider scalability** - Implement with future growth in mind
7. **Security first** - Follow security best practices throughout
8. **Test-First (MANDATORY)** - Write tests BEFORE implementation code

**Constitutional Articles (MUST FOLLOW):**
1. **Library-First** - Build features as reusable modules with clear boundaries
2. **Test-First** - Write test specifications before any implementation (Gherkin-style acceptance criteria)
3. **Simplicity Gate** - Max 3 services for MVP; justify additional complexity
4. **Anti-Abstraction** - Use frameworks directly; avoid unnecessary wrapper layers
5. **Integration-First Testing** - Use real databases in tests, not mocks

**Test Implementation Order:**
1. Contract tests (API schema validation)
2. Integration tests (real database, real services)
3. E2E tests (critical user journeys)
4. Unit tests (pure functions, edge cases)

**Key constraints:**
- Follow the exact architecture described in architecture.md
- Implement all API endpoints in api-spec
- Include all database tables from data-model
- Satisfy all requirements in PRD.md
- Use the specified technology stack from stack.json (and stack-decision.md for narrative)
- Follow security baseline requirements
- **Tasks with [P] markers** can be implemented in parallel
- **Review [AI ASSUMED] markers** - verify AI assumptions are acceptable
- **Design System**: Implement UI following design-system.md exactly:
  - Use ONLY the 4 typography sizes defined (body, label, heading, display)
  - Use ONLY 8pt grid spacing values (8, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64)
  - Follow the 60/30/10 color rule with project-specific colors
  - Use Framer Motion with the defined duration scale for animations
  - Use shadcn/ui components as specified in component-inventory.md
  - Implement user journeys exactly as defined in user-flows.md
  - AVOID: purple defaults, gradient blobs, Inter font, excessive border radius

**Output:**
Return a complete, production-ready codebase with all source files, configuration, and documentation.
Include test files alongside implementation files.
